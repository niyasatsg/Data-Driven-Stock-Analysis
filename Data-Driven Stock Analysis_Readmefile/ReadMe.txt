Project Name: Data-Driven Stock Analysis

Description: The Stock Performance Dashboard project aims to 
deliver a robust and interactive platform for visualizing and analyzing the performance of Nifty 
50 stocks over the past year. By leveraging advanced data processing and visualization tools, 
this project will provide valuable insights into stock trends, helping investors, analysts, and 
enthusiasts make informed decisions. The dashboard will utilize daily stock data, including 
open, close, high, low, and volume values, to generate comprehensive performance metrics 
and visualizations..

•	 The Stock Performance Dashboard project aims to 
deliver a robust and interactive platform for visualizing and analyzing the performance of Nifty 
50 stocks over the past year. By leveraging advanced data processing and visualization tools, 
this project will provide valuable insights into stock trends, helping investors, analysts, and

open, close, high, low, and volume values, to generate comprehensive performance metrics 
and visualizations.

Data Cleaning
• 	Data Source: The data is provided in YAML format, organized by months. 
Each month's folder contains date-wise data entries.
• 	Objective: The main task is to extract data from the YAML files and transform it into CSV format, organized by symbols.
• 	Output: The extraction process will result in 50 CSV files, each corresponding to a specific symbol or data categoryData Analysis Page

Volatility Analysis
•	Objective: To visualize the volatility of each stock over the past year by calculating the standard deviation of daily returns.
•	Purpose: Understanding volatility helps in assessing the risk associated with each stock. Higher volatility indicates greater risk, while lower volatility suggests a more stable stock.

Cumulative Return
•	Objective: To illustrate the cumulative return of each stock from the beginning to the end of the year.
•	Purpose: Cumulative return is a key metric for visualizing overall performance and growth over time, enabling users to compare the performance of different stocks.

Sector-wise Performance
•	Objective: To provide a detailed breakdown of stock performance by sector, using sec-tor data shared in CSV format.
•	Purpose: Sector performance analysis helps investors and analysts gauge market sen-timent in specific industries, such as IT, Financials, Energy, etc.

Stock Price Correlation
•	Objective: To visualize the correlation between the stock prices of different companies.
•	Purpose: Understanding stock price correlations helps identify if certain stocks tend to move together, which can be indicative of market trends or sector performance.

•	Objective: To provide detailed monthly breakdowns of the top-performing and worst-performing stocks.
